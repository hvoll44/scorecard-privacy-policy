    <h1>ScoreCard Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 8, 2024</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to ScoreCard. This privacy policy outlines the types of information we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to protect your privacy. By using ScoreCard, you agree to the terms of this policy.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Local Data Storage:</strong> ScoreCard stores game info such as scores and player names on the user's device. This data is stored locally and is not transmitted to any external servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Game Sharing:</strong> Users have the option to share their game with others using a randomly generated 6-digit code. This code allows other participants to join the game and enter scores and player names in real-time. The information shared through this feature is only accessible to the participants of the specific game session.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p><strong>Local Data:</strong> The data stored for local games is kept on the user's device and is not shared with any external entities. We recommend that users protect their device with a secure password to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
    <p><strong>Game Sharing:</strong> The randomly generated 6-digit code is only valid for a duration. After it expires the data is removed from the server.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app and on the Google Play Store listing. The date of the most recent update will always be reflected at the top of the policy.</p>
